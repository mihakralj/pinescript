# Oscillators

| Code | Name | Key Characteristics |

| [AC](/indicators/oscillators/ac.md) | Acceleration Oscillator | Measures acceleration/deceleration of the current market driving force (Awesome Oscillator) |
| [AO](/indicators/oscillators/ao.md) | Awesome Oscillator | Measures market momentum by comparing recent momentum to overall momentum |
| [APO](/indicators/oscillators/apo.md) | Absolute Price Oscillator | Shows difference between two exponential moving averages of price |
| BBI | Bulls Bears Index | Measures the relative strength of bulls and bears based on price action |
| [BOP](/indicators/oscillators/bop.md) | Balance of Power | Measures the strength of buyers vs. sellers by relating price change to the trading range |

| [CCI](/indicators/oscillators/cci.md) | Commodity Channel Index | Measures price deviation from its statistical mean, identifies cyclical turns |
| CFO | Chande Forecast Oscillator | Measures the percentage difference between the closing price and its N-period linear regression forecast |
| CG | Center of Gravity | Lag-free indicator identifying turning points based on weighted price distribution |
| CHOP | Choppiness Index | Measures market sidewaysness or trendiness, higher values indicate choppiness |
| COPPOCK | Coppock Curve | Long-term momentum oscillator used primarily for identifying major market bottoms |
| CRSI | Connors RSI | Composite indicator combining RSI, Up/Down Streak Length, and Rate-of-Change |
| CTI | Correlation Trend Indicator | Measures the correlation between price and time to determine trend strength |
| DOSC | Derivative Oscillator | Measures the difference between a double-smoothed RSI and its signal line |
| ER | Efficiency Ratio | Measures price efficiency by comparing net price movement to total price movement (KAMA component) |
| ERI | Elder Ray Index | Measures buying (Bull Power) and selling (Bear Power) pressure relative to an EMA |
| FISHER | Fisher Transform | Converts price data into a Gaussian normal distribution to identify price reversals |
| FOSC | Forecast Oscillator | Plots the percentage difference between a forecast price (e.g., linear regression) and the actual price |
| [INERTIA](/indicators/oscillators/inertia.md) | Inertia | Measures trend strength based on the distance of the current price from a linear regression line |
| KDJ | KDJ Indicator | Stochastic-like oscillator showing location of close relative to high-low range (%K, %D, %J lines) |
| KRI | Kairi Relative Index | Measures the deviation of the current price from its simple moving average |
| KST | KST Oscillator | Smoothed, weighted Rate-of-Change oscillator combining multiple timeframes |
| PGO | Pretty Good Oscillator | Measures distance of current close from its N-period simple moving average |
| PSL | Psychological Line | Measures percentage of days closing up over a specified period, gauges sentiment |
| QQE | Quantitative Qualitative Estimation | Smoothing technique applied to RSI, providing trade signals via signal line crossovers |
| RVGI | Relative Vigor Index | (Often synonymous with RVI) Compares closing price to trading range |
| [SMI](/indicators/oscillators/smi.md) | Stochastic Momentum Index | Measures distance of current close relative to the midpoint of the high/low range |
| SQUEEZE | Squeeze | Identifies periods of low volatility (Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channels) for potential breakouts |
| [STOCH](/indicators/oscillators/stoch.md) | Stochastic Oscillator | Compares close to price range over time, identifies overbought/oversold conditions |
| [STOCHF](/indicators/oscillators/stochf.md) | Stochastic Fast | Non-smoothed version of the Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D) |
| [STOCHRSI](/indicators/oscillators/stochrsi.md) | Stochastic RSI | Applies the Stochastic formula to RSI values, providing more sensitive signals |
| TD_SEQ | TD Sequential | Identifies potential price exhaustion points and reversals based on price bar counting |
| [TRIX](/indicators/oscillators/trix.md) | Triple Exponential Average | Measures percentage rate of change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average |
| [ULTOSC](/indicators/oscillators/ultosc.md) | Ultimate Oscillator | Weighted average of three Stochastic oscillators using different time periods |
| [WILLR](/indicators/oscillators/willr.md) | Williams %R | Measures overbought/oversold levels, inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator |
