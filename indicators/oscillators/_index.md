| CRSI | Connors RSI | Composite indicator combining RSI, Up/Down Streak Length, and Rate-of-Change |
| CTI | Correlation Trend Indicator | Measures the correlation between price and time to determine trend strength |
| DOSC | Derivative Oscillator | Measures the difference between a double-smoothed RSI and its signal line |
| EFI | Elder Force Index | Combines price movement, direction, and volume to measure buying/selling power |
| ER | Efficiency Ratio | Measures price efficiency by comparing net price movement to total price movement (KAMA component) |
| ERI | Elder Ray Index | Measures buying (Bull Power) and selling (Bear Power) pressure relative to an EMA |
| FISHER | Fisher Transform | Converts price data into a Gaussian normal distribution to identify price reversals |
| FOSC | Forecast Oscillator | Plots the percentage difference between a forecast price (e.g., linear regression) and the actual price |
| INERTIA | Inertia | Measures trend strength based on the distance of the current price from a linear regression line |
| KDJ | KDJ Indicator | Stochastic-like oscillator showing location of close relative to high-low range (%K, %D, %J lines) |
| KRI | Kairi Relative Index | Measures the deviation of the current price from its simple moving average |
| KST | KST Oscillator | Smoothed, weighted Rate-of-Change oscillator combining multiple timeframes |
| MFI | Money Flow Index | Volume-weighted RSI, measures buying/selling pressure using price and volume |
| MOM | Momentum | Measures the rate of price change over a specified period |
| PGO | Pretty Good Oscillator | Measures distance of current close from its N-period simple moving average |
| PPO | Percentage Price Oscillator | Shows relationship between two moving averages in percentage terms (MACD as percentage) |
| PSL | Psychological Line | Measures percentage of days closing up over a specified period, gauges sentiment |
| PVO | Percentage Volume Oscillator | Compares short-term and long-term volume moving averages as percentages |
| QQE | Quantitative Qualitative Estimation | Smoothing technique applied to RSI, providing trade signals via signal line crossovers |
| ROC | Rate of Change | Measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price N periods ago |
| RSI | Relative Strength Index | Measures speed and change of price movements, identifies overbought/oversold conditions |
| RSX | Relative Strength Xtra | Smoother version of RSI with reduced lag |
| RVI | Relative Vigor Index | Compares closing price to trading range, smoothed with moving averages |
| RVGI | Relative Vigor Index | (Often synonymous with RVI) Compares closing price to trading range |
| SLOPE | Slope | Measures the slope of a linear regression line fitted to price data |
| SMI | Stochastic Momentum Index | Measures distance of current close relative to the midpoint of the high/low range |
| SQUEEZE | Squeeze | Identifies periods of low volatility (Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channels) for potential breakouts |
| [STOCH](/indicators/oscillators/stoch.md) | Stochastic Volatility | Models volatility as a random process, often used in options pricing |
| STOCHF | Stochastic Fast | Non-smoothed version of the Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D) |
| STOCHRSI | Stochastic RSI | Applies the Stochastic formula to RSI values, providing more sensitive signals |
| TD_SEQ | TD Sequential | Identifies potential price exhaustion points and reversals based on price bar counting |
| TRIX | Triple Exponential Average | Measures percentage rate of change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average |
| TSI | True Strength Index | Double-smoothed momentum oscillator based on price changes |
| ULTOSC | Ultimate Oscillator | Weighted average of three Stochastic oscillators using different time periods |
| WILLR | Williams %R | Measures overbought/oversold levels, inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator |
