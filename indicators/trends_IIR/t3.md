# Tillson T3 Moving Average (T3)

The Tillson T3 Moving Average is an advanced smoothing algorithm developed by Tim Tillson that implements a sophisticated six-stage EMA architecture with optimized coefficient distribution based on a volume factor parameter. T3 effectively reduces lag while providing superior noise reduction compared to traditional moving averages. Introduced by Tim Tillson in the January 1998 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, T3 quickly gained recognition for its superior smoothing capabilities. Its adoption has grown steadily among professional traders seeking a balance between responsiveness and noise reduction. The T3's unique approach to coefficient optimization has influenced the development of numerous advanced moving averages in technical analysis.

## Core Concepts

The T3 indicator was designed to address limitations in traditional moving averages and earlier triple-EMA approaches. Its key innovations include:

- Six-stage EMA cascade for superior smoothing
- Volume factor parameter for customizable behavior
- Optimized coefficient distribution to minimize lag
- Strategic weighting to prevent overshooting at turning points

## Mathematical Foundation

T3 is calculated by applying six EMAs in sequence and combining them using optimized coefficients based on a volume factor:

T3 = c1 × EMA6 + c2 × EMA5 + c3 × EMA4 + c4 × EMA3

Where:

- EMA1 through EMA6 are exponential moving averages applied in sequence
- c1 through c4 are coefficients derived from the volume factor
- Each EMA uses the same alpha value derived from the period
- The volume factor (default 0.7) controls the smoothing behavior

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Alpha Calculation:**
   - Alpha = 2 / (period + 1) - Standard EMA alpha formula

2. **Coefficient Calculation:**
   - v2 = v × v - Square of volume factor
   - v3 = v2 × v - Cube of volume factor
   - c1 = -v3 - First coefficient
   - c2 = 3.0 × (v2 + v3) - Second coefficient
   - c3 = -3.0 × (2.0 × v2 + v + v3) - Third coefficient
   - c4 = 1.0 + 3.0 × v + 3.0 × v2 + v3 - Fourth coefficient

3. **EMA Chain Calculation:**
   - Six EMA values (e1 through e6) are calculated in sequence:
     - e1 = e1 + alpha × (src - e1)
     - e2 = e2 + alpha × (e1 - e2)
     - e3 = e3 + alpha × (e2 - e3)
     - e4 = e4 + alpha × (e3 - e4)
     - e5 = e5 + alpha × (e4 - e5)
     - e6 = e6 + alpha × (e5 - e6)

4. **T3 Final Value:**
   - T3 = c1 × e6 + c2 × e5 + c3 × e4 + c4 × e3

## Parameters

- **source**: Input data series (default: close)
- **period**: Smoothing period (default: 10)
- **volume factor** (v): Controls the behavior of the T3 (default: 0.7)
  - Values closer to 0 reduce lag but increase noise
  - Values closer to 1 increase smoothing but also increase lag

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Superior Smoothing:** Six-stage EMA cascade provides excellent noise reduction
- **Minimal Lag:** Optimized coefficients maintain responsiveness despite multiple stages
- **Configurable:** Volume factor parameter allows fine-tuning of behavior
- **No Overshooting:** Better behaved than triple EMA in volatile conditions

### Disadvantages

- **Computational Complexity:** More complex than standard moving averages
- **Parameter Sensitivity:** Results highly dependent on volume factor choice
- **Memory Requirements:** Maintains multiple state variables for calculations
- **Initialization Period:** Requires more bars for full optimization

## Usage Recommendations

### Optimal Applications

- **Trend Following**: T3 excels in identifying and following established trends
- **Noise Filtering**: Superior at filtering market noise while maintaining trend responsiveness
- **Signal Generation**: Effective in crossover systems with price or other moving averages
- **Swing Trading**: Ideal balance of smoothness and responsiveness for intermediate timeframes

### Parameter Selection

- **Period (5-10)**: More responsive, suitable for shorter-term trading
- **Period (10-20)**: Balanced approach for swing trading
- **Period (20+)**: Identifies major trends with excellent noise filtering
- **Volume Factor (0.5-0.7)**: Standard setting for balanced performance
- **Volume Factor (0.3-0.5)**: More responsive but less smooth
- **Volume Factor (0.7-0.9)**: Smoother but with increased lag

### Complementary Indicators

T3 performs best when combined with:

- **Momentum Oscillators**: RSI or MACD to confirm trend strength
- **Volume Indicators**: OBV or Volume Profile to validate price movements
- **Volatility Measures**: ATR or Bollinger Bands to assess market conditions
- **Support/Resistance Tools**: Pivot points or Fibonacci levels for entry/exit points
