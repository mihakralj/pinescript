# T3: Tillson T3 Moving Average

[Pine Script Implementation of T3](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/trends_IIR/t3.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

The Tillson T3 Moving Average is an advanced technical indicator designed to provide superior smoothing with minimal lag. Developed by Tim Tillson and introduced in the January 1998 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, T3 implements a sophisticated six-stage EMA architecture with optimized coefficient distribution based on a volume factor parameter.

Unlike simpler moving averages or even triple-EMA approaches, T3 uses a unique mathematical framework that strategically combines multiple EMAs with precisely calculated coefficients. This approach creates a moving average that effectively reduces noise while preserving important trend information and minimizing lag. T3 has gained significant popularity among professional traders seeking the optimal balance between responsiveness and noise reduction.

## Core Concepts

* **Multi-stage smoothing:** Uses a six-stage EMA cascade with optimized coefficient distribution to achieve superior noise reduction while minimizing lag
* **Volume factor customization:** Provides a parameter that allows traders to fine-tune the balance between smoothness and responsiveness
* **Strategic coefficient weighting:** Employs a sophisticated formula that prevents overshooting at turning points while maintaining responsiveness
* **Timeframe versatility:** Performs well across multiple timeframes with appropriate parameter adjustments

T3 achieves its exceptional performance through a unique approach that cascades six EMAs and then combines them using coefficients derived from a volume factor parameter. This creates a moving average that responds more quickly to genuine trend changes while filtering out random fluctuations more effectively than traditional moving averages.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Length | 10 | Controls basic smoothing period | Increase for longer-term trends, decrease for shorter-term signals |
| Volume Factor | 0.7 | Determines behavior between responsive and smooth | Lower (0.3-0.5) for more responsiveness, higher (0.7-0.9) for more smoothness |
| Source | Close | Data point used for calculation | Change to HL2 or HLC3 for more balanced price representation |

**Pro Tip:** Many professional traders find that a volume factor of 0.618 (the golden ratio) provides an optimal balance between smoothness and responsiveness across most market conditions.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
T3 works by running price data through a series of six EMAs, then combining the outputs of these EMAs using carefully calculated weights. These weights are determined by a "volume factor" parameter that controls how much the indicator prioritizes smoothness versus responsiveness.

**Technical formula:**
T3 = c1 √ó EMA6 + c2 √ó EMA5 + c3 √ó EMA4 + c4 √ó EMA3

Where:
- EMA1 through EMA6 are exponential moving averages applied in sequence
- c1 through c4 are coefficients derived from the volume factor:
  - c1 = -v¬≥
  - c2 = 3 √ó (v¬≤ + v¬≥)
  - c3 = -3 √ó (2v¬≤ + v + v¬≥)
  - c4 = 1 + 3v + 3v¬≤ + v¬≥
- v is the volume factor (default 0.7)
- Each EMA uses the same alpha (Œ± = 2/(period + 1))

> üîç **Technical Note:** The six-stage EMA cascade is calculated sequentially: e1 = EMA(source), e2 = EMA(e1), e3 = EMA(e2), and so on. The final combination using the coefficients creates a sophisticated polynomial that optimizes smoothing while minimizing lag. This is fundamentally different from simple moving average combinations because of the strategic coefficient distribution.

## Interpretation Details

T3 excels at identifying the underlying trend while filtering out market noise:

- When price crosses above T3, it often signals the beginning of an uptrend
- When price crosses below T3, it often signals the beginning of a downtrend
- The slope of T3 provides insight into trend strength and momentum
- T3 creates smoother, more reliable support and resistance levels than simpler moving averages
- Multiple T3 lines with different periods can form a "ribbon" that helps visualize trend strength

T3 is particularly valuable in trend-following strategies, where its superior smoothing helps eliminate false signals while its minimal lag allows for timely entries and exits. It also performs exceptionally well in swing trading, where identifying clean trend changes is critical.

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Market conditions:** Less effective in extremely choppy, sideways markets where even sophisticated smoothing cannot extract meaningful trends
* **Computational complexity:** More resource-intensive than simple moving averages due to the six-stage calculation
* **Parameter sensitivity:** Results highly dependent on volume factor choice, requiring careful optimization for different markets
* **Initialization period:** Requires more bars for full optimization than simpler moving averages
* **Complementary tools:** Works best when combined with momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) or volume indicators for confirmation
