# Tillson T3 Moving Average (T3)

The Tillson T3 Moving Average is an advanced smoothing algorithm developed by Tim Tillson that implements a sophisticated six-stage EMA architecture with optimized coefficient distribution based on a volume factor parameter. T3 effectively reduces lag while providing superior noise reduction compared to traditional moving averages.

## Mathematical Foundation

T3 is calculated by applying six EMAs in sequence and combining them using optimized coefficients based on a volume factor:

T3 = c1 × EMA6 + c2 × EMA5 + c3 × EMA4 + c4 × EMA3

Where:

- EMA1 through EMA6 are exponential moving averages applied in sequence
- c1 through c4 are coefficients derived from the volume factor
- Each EMA uses the same alpha value derived from the period
- The volume factor (default 0.7) controls the smoothing behavior

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Alpha Calculation:**
   - Alpha = 2 / (period + 1) - Standard EMA alpha formula

2. **Coefficient Calculation:**
   - v2 = v × v - Square of volume factor
   - v3 = v2 × v - Cube of volume factor
   - c1 = -v3 - First coefficient
   - c2 = 3.0 × (v2 + v3) - Second coefficient
   - c3 = -3.0 × (2.0 × v2 + v + v3) - Third coefficient
   - c4 = 1.0 + 3.0 × v + 3.0 × v2 + v3 - Fourth coefficient

3. **EMA Chain Calculation:**
   - Six EMA values (e1 through e6) are calculated in sequence:
     - e1 = e1 + alpha × (src - e1)
     - e2 = e2 + alpha × (e1 - e2)
     - e3 = e3 + alpha × (e2 - e3)
     - e4 = e4 + alpha × (e3 - e4)
     - e5 = e5 + alpha × (e4 - e5)
     - e6 = e6 + alpha × (e5 - e6)

4. **T3 Final Value:**
   - T3 = c1 × e6 + c2 × e5 + c3 × e4 + c4 × e3

## Parameters

- **source**: Input data series (default: close)
- **period**: Smoothing period (default: 10)
- **volume factor** (v): Controls the behavior of the T3 (default: 0.7)
  - Values closer to 0 reduce lag but increase noise
  - Values closer to 1 increase smoothing but also increase lag

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Superior Smoothing:** Six-stage EMA cascade provides excellent noise reduction
- **Minimal Lag:** Optimized coefficients maintain responsiveness despite multiple stages
- **Configurable:** Volume factor parameter allows fine-tuning of behavior
- **No Overshooting:** Better behaved than triple EMA in volatile conditions

### Disadvantages

- **Computational Complexity:** More complex than standard moving averages
- **Parameter Sensitivity:** Results highly dependent on volume factor choice
- **Memory Requirements:** Maintains multiple state variables for calculations
- **Initialization Period:** Requires more bars for full optimization
