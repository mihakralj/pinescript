# Trend Dynamics

| Code | Name | Key Characteristics |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ADX](/indicators/dynamics/adx.md) | Average Directional Movement Index | Measures trend strength, regardless of direction (uses +DI and -DI) |
| [ADXR](/indicators/dynamics/adxr.md) | Average Directional Movement Rating | Smoothed version of ADX, often used in conjunction with ADX for signals |
| [ALLIGATOR](/indicators/dynamics/alligator.md) | Williams Alligator | Uses three smoothed moving averages (Jaw, Teeth, Lips) to identify trends and trading ranges |
| [AROON](/indicators/dynamics/aroon.md) | Aroon | Identifies trend direction and strength by measuring time since price recorded new highs/lows |
| [AROONOSC](/indicators/dynamics/aroonosc.md) | Aroon Oscillator | Single-line oscillator (Aroon Up - Aroon Down); positive = bullish, negative = bearish |
| [DMX](/indicators/dynamics/dmx.md) | Jurik Directional Movement Index | Smoothed Bipolar Directional Movement Index (DMI) |
| [DX](/indicators/dynamics/dx.md) | Directional Movement Index | Measures directional strength; unsmoothed component of ADX (100 * abs(+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI)) |
| [IMI](/indicators/dynamics/imi.md) | Intraday Momentum Index | RSI-like indicator using intraday ranges (open vs close); identifies overbought/oversold conditions |
| [VORTEX](/indicators/dynamics/vortex.md) | Vortex Indicator | Uses VI+ and VI- to identify trend direction and strength based on vortex price movement |
| [CHOP](/indicators/dynamics/chop.md) | Choppiness Index | Non-directional indicator measuring market trendiness; higher values indicate choppy sideways markets |
| [QSTICK](/indicators/dynamics/qstick.md) | Qstick Indicator | Measures buying/selling pressure through moving average of close-open differences; positive = bullish, negative = bearish |
| [SUPER](/indicators/dynamics/super.md) | SuperTrend | ATR-based trend following with dynamic support/resistance; green line below price = bullish, red above = bearish |
| [TTM](/indicators/dynamics/ttm.md) | TTM Trend | Fast 6-period EMA with color-coded trend; green = bullish, red = bearish; part of John Carter's TTM system |
| [AMAT](/indicators/dynamics/amat.md) | Archer Moving Averages Trends | Trend identification using multiple EMAs; requires alignment of fast/slow EMAs and directional movement |
| HT_TRENDMODE | Hilbert Transform - Trend vs Cycle Mode | Uses Hilbert Transform to determine if the market is in a trending or cycling phase |
