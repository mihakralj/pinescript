| Code | Name | Key Characteristics |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [BOP](/indicators/momentum/bop.md) | Balance of Power | Measures the strength of buyers vs. sellers by relating price change to the trading range |
| [CCI](/indicators/momentum/cci.md) | Commodity Channel Index | Measures price deviation from its statistical mean, identifies cyclical turns |
| [CMO](/indicators/momentum/cmo.md) | Chande Momentum Oscillator | Measures momentum using both up and down price changes, similar to RSI but unbounded |
| [MFI](/indicators/momentum/mfi.md) | Money Flow Index | Volume-weighted RSI, measures buying/selling pressure using price and volume |
| [MOM](/indicators/momentum/mom.md) | Momentum | Measures the rate of price change over a specified period |
| [VEL](/indicators/momentum/vel.md) | Jurik Velocity | Advanced momentum oscillator with zero-lag smoothing using JMA |
| [PMO](/indicators/momentum/pmo.md) | Price Momentum Oscillator | Double-smoothed Rate of Change (ROC) oscillator |
| [PPO](/indicators/momentum/ppo.md) | Percentage Price Oscillator | Shows relationship between two moving averages in percentage terms (MACD as percentage) |
| [PRS](/indicators/momentum/prs.md) | Price Relative Strength | Compares the performance of one asset relative to another (ratio) |
| [ROC](/indicators/momentum/roc.md) | Rate of Change | Measures the absolute change in price between the current price and the price N periods ago |
| [ROCP](/indicators/momentum/rocp.md) | Rate of Change Percentage | Measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price N periods ago |
| [ROCR](/indicators/momentum/rocr.md) | Rate of Change Ratio | Measures the ratio of the current price to the price N periods ago |
| [RSI](/indicators/momentum/rsi.md) | Relative Strength Index | Measures speed and change of price movements, identifies overbought/oversold conditions |
| [RSX](/indicators/momentum/rsx.md) | Jurik Relative Strength Quality Index | Enhanced RSI with JMA smoothing for cleaner signals |
| [TRIX](/indicators/momentum/trix.md) | Triple Exponential ROC | Measures percentage rate of change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average |
| [TSI](/indicators/momentum/tsi.md) | True Strength Index | Double-smoothed momentum oscillator based on price changes |
| [ULTOSC](/indicators/momentum/ultosc.md) | Ultimate Oscillator | Weighted average of three Stochastic oscillators using different time periods |
| [WILLR](/indicators/momentum/willr.md) | Williams %R | Measures overbought/oversold levels, inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator |
