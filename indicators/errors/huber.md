# HUBER: Huber Loss

[Pine Script Implementation of HUBER](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/errors/huber.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

The Huber Loss is a hybrid error metric that combines the best properties of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Developed by statistician Peter J. Huber in 1964, this metric addresses the need for robust regression that remains sensitive to small errors while reducing the influence of outliers. In financial analysis, Huber Loss provides a balanced approach to error measurement that adapts to varying market conditions, making it particularly valuable when analyzing signals that contain both subtle patterns and occasional extreme movements.

## Core Concepts

* **Adaptive behavior:** Transitions smoothly between quadratic treatment of small errors and linear treatment of large errors
* **Outlier resilience:** Reduces the influence of extreme values while maintaining sensitivity to smaller deviations
* **Market application:** Particularly effective for model evaluation in volatile markets where both precision and robustness are required

The core innovation of Huber Loss is its threshold parameter (delta) that determines when the function switches from quadratic to linear behavior. This creates an error metric that behaves like MSE for errors smaller than delta (preserving sensitivity to small deviations) but switches to MAE-like behavior for larger errors (providing robustness against outliers).

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Length | 14 | Controls the averaging period | Increase for smoother error measurements, decrease for more responsiveness |
| Delta | 1.345 | Threshold between quadratic and linear regions | Lower values increase robustness against outliers, higher values improve sensitivity to small errors |
| Source 1 | close | First signal for comparison | Typically your actual or predicted value |
| Source 2 | sma(close,20) | Second signal for comparison | Typically your model or another signal to compare against |

**Pro Tip:** The default delta value of 1.345 provides 95% statistical efficiency for normally distributed data, but in financial markets with fat-tailed distributions, consider using lower values (0.8-1.0) to better handle unexpected price movements.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
Huber Loss measures the difference between two signals, treating small differences like MSE (squaring them) and large differences like MAE (using absolute values). This gives you the best of both worlds - sensitivity to small errors and resistance to outliers.

**Technical formula:**
For each pair of values (Y‚ÇÅ, Y‚ÇÇ):
- If |Y‚ÇÅ - Y‚ÇÇ| ‚â§ Œ¥: Loss = 0.5(Y‚ÇÅ - Y‚ÇÇ)¬≤
- If |Y‚ÇÅ - Y‚ÇÇ| > Œ¥: Loss = Œ¥|Y‚ÇÅ - Y‚ÇÇ| - 0.5Œ¥¬≤

Final Huber Loss is the average of these values over the specified period.

> üîç **Technical Note:** The subtraction of 0.5Œ¥¬≤ in the linear region ensures continuity at the transition point, making Huber Loss differentiable everywhere - a valuable property for optimization algorithms.

## Interpretation Details

Huber Loss can be applied in various financial contexts:

* **Model evaluation:** Compare prediction accuracy between different forecasting models
* **Signal comparison:** Measure how closely two indicators track each other while accounting for occasional divergences
* **Anomaly detection:** Identify unusual market behavior by measuring deviation from expected patterns
* **Optimization criteria:** Use as a robust loss function when developing trading algorithms
* **Regime detection:** Track changes in error characteristics to identify shifts in market conditions

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Scale dependency:** Values depend on the scale of input signals, making comparisons across different instruments challenging
* **Parameter sensitivity:** Performance depends on appropriate delta selection for the specific market conditions
* **Additional complexity:** More computationally intensive than simple error metrics
* **Non-directional:** Cannot distinguish between positive and negative errors without modification
* **Complementary metrics:** Best used alongside other error measures for comprehensive evaluation
