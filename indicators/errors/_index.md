# Error Metrics

| Code | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| [DIRTY](/indicators/errors/dirty.md) | Dirty Data Injection | Simulates dirty or corrupted data for robustness testing |
| [HUBER](/indicators/errors/huber.md) | Huber Loss | Combines MSE and MAE to be less sensitive to outliers |
| [MAE](/indicators/errors/mae.md) | Mean Absolute Error | Measures the average magnitude of errors without considering direction |
| [MAPD](/indicators/errors/mapd.md) | Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation | Measures the average percentage deviation from expected values |
| [MAPE](/indicators/errors/mape.md) | Mean Absolute Percentage Error | Expresses accuracy as a percentage of error compared to actual values |
| [MASE](/indicators/errors/mase.md) | Mean Absolute Scaled Error | Scales the MAE by the MAE of a naive forecast |
| [MDA](/indicators/errors/mda.md) | Mean Directional Accuracy | Measures how often the predicted direction matches the actual direction |
| [ME](/indicators/errors/me.md) | Mean Error | Measures the average difference between predicted and actual values |
| [MPE](/indicators/errors/mpe.md) | Mean Percentage Error | Measures the percentage difference between predicted and actual values |
| [MSE](/indicators/errors/mse.md) | Mean Squared Error | Measures the average squared differences between predicted and actual values |
| [MSLE](/indicators/errors/msle.md) | Mean Squared Logarithmic Error | Penalizes underestimations more than overestimations using log scale |
| [RAE](/indicators/errors/rae.md) | Relative Absolute Error | Normalizes the total absolute error against a simple predictor |
| [RMSE](/indicators/errors/rmse.md) | Root Mean Squared Error | Square root of MSE that gives higher weight to large errors |
| [RMSLE](/indicators/errors/rmsle.md) | Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error | Square root of MSLE that reduces the impact of large errors on log scale |
| [RSE](/indicators/errors/rse.md) | Relative Squared Error | Normalizes the sum of squared errors against a simple predictor |
| [RSQUARED](/indicators/errors/rsquared.md) | R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination) | Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model |
| [SMAPE](/indicators/errors/smape.md) | Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error | Symmetric version of MAPE that treats over and under predictions equally |
