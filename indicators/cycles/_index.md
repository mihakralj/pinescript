# Cycles Indicators

| Code | Name | Key Characteristics |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [CFB](/indicators/cycles/cfb.md) | Composite Fractal Behavior | Measures market fractal behavior using composite fractal dimension analysis |
| [CG](/indicators/cycles/cg.md) | Center of Gravity | Ehlers' Center of Gravity indicator, which uses a weighted moving average to identify cycles |
| [EBSW](/indicators/cycles/ebsw.md) | Ehlers Even Better Sinewave | Detrends data and uses smoothed cycle to plot sinewave and lead sinewave for cycle analysis |
| [LUNAR](/indicators/cycles/lunar.md) | Lunar Phase | High-precision lunar phase incorporating orbital perturbations and epoch corrections |
| [PHASOR](/indicators/cycles/phasor.md) | Ehlers Phasor Analysis | Identifies cycle phase using Ehlers' correlation method; includes unwrapping and trend state logic. |
| [SINE](/indicators/cycles/sine.md) | Ehlers Sine Wave | Original cycle indicator plotting sine and lead-sine waves based on an assumed dominant cycle period |
| [SOLAR](/indicators/cycles/solar.md) | Solar Cycle | High-precision seasonal cycle based on solar position using astronomical formulas |
| [STC](/indicators/cycles/stc.md) | Schaff Trend Cycle | Measures cycles and trends using a combination of Macd and stochastic calculations |
| EACP | Ehlers Autocorrelation Periodogram | Ehlers indicator using autocorrelation to estimate the dominant cycle period |
| HOMOD | Homodyne Discriminator | Ehlers indicator designed to measure the instantaneous frequency of market cycles |
| [HT_DCPERIOD](/indicators/cycles/ht_dcperiod.md) | Hilbert Transform - Dominant Cycle Period | Uses Hilbert Transform to measure the dominant cycle period in price data |
| [HT_DCPHASE](/indicators/cycles/ht_dcphase.md) | Hilbert Transform - Dominant Cycle Phase | Uses Hilbert Transform to measure the phase angle of the dominant cycle (-π to π radians) |
| [HT_PHASOR](/indicators/cycles/ht_phasor.md) | Hilbert Transform - Phasor Components | Returns I (In-phase) and Q (Quadrature) components for advanced cycle analysis and custom indicator development |
| [HT_SINE](/indicators/cycles/ht_sine.md) | Hilbert Transform - SineWave | Generates sine and lead-sine wave plots with crossover signals for cycle timing and reversal identification |
| DSP | Detrended Synthetic Price | Ehlers indicator that removes trend component to reveal underlying cycle structure |
