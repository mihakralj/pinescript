| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DSS | Double Smoothed Stochastic | Smoother version of the Stochastic oscillator, designed to reduce noise |
| EBSW | Even Better Sinewave | Ehlers indicator attempting to improve upon the basic Sine Wave cycle measurement |
| EACP | Ehlers Autocorrelation Periodogram | Ehlers indicator using autocorrelation to estimate the dominant cycle period |
| HOMOD | Homodyne Discriminator | Ehlers indicator designed to measure the instantaneous frequency of market cycles |
| HT_DCPERIOD | Hilbert Transform - Dominant Cycle Period | Uses Hilbert Transform to measure the dominant cycle period in price data |
| HT_DCPHASE | Hilbert Transform - Dominant Cycle Phase | Uses Hilbert Transform to measure the phase of the dominant cycle |
| HT_PHASOR | Hilbert Transform - Phasor Components | Provides the complex phasor components (real and imaginary) from the Hilbert Transform |
| HT_SINE | Hilbert Transform - SineWave | Generates sine and lead-sine wave plots based on the dominant cycle identified by Hilbert Transform |
| SINE | Sine Wave | Basic cycle indicator plotting sine and lead-sine waves based on an assumed dominant cycle period |
