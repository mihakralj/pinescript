# Signal Filters

| Indicator | Name | Key Characteristics |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| [BESSEL](/indicators/filters/bessel.md) | Bessel Filter | Preserves signal shape with maximally flat group delay and minimal waveform distortion |
| [BILATERAL](/indicators/filters/bilateral.md) | Bilateral Filter | Edge-preserving non-linear filter that maintains significant price transitions |
| [BPF](/indicators/filters/bpf.md) | Ehlers Bandpass Filter | Isolates specific frequency ranges to detect cycles and rhythmic patterns |
| [BUTTER](/indicators/filters/butter.md) | Butterworth Filter | Maximally flat magnitude response in passband with good roll-off characteristics |
| [CHEBY1](/indicators/filters/cheby1.md) | Chebyshev Type I Filter | Steeper roll-off than Butterworth with controlled passband ripple |
| [CHEBY2](/indicators/filters/cheby2.md) | Chebyshev Type II Filter | Maximally flat passband with ripples in stopband for efficient noise reduction |
| [ELLIPTIC](/indicators/filters/elliptic.md) | Elliptic (Cauer) Filter | Steepest possible roll-off with controlled ripples in both bands |
| [GAUSS](/indicators/filters/gauss.md)  | Gaussian Filter | Provides smooth, edge-preserving low-pass filtering with bell-shaped weights |
| [HANN](/indicators/filters/hann.md) | Hann FIR Filter | Smooth tapering FIR filter using Hann window to reduce spectral leakage |
| [HPF](/indicators/filters/hpf.md) | Ehlers Highpass Filter | Removes trends while preserving shorter-term movements for mean reversion strategies |
| [HP](/indicators/filters/hp.md) | Hodrick-Prescott Filter | Decomposes price into trend and cyclical components |
| [KF](/indicators/filters/kf.md) | Kalman Filter | Optimal recursive estimator that adapts to changing market dynamics |
| [LOESS](/indicators/filters/loess.md) | LOESS/LOWESS Smoothing | Locally weighted regression that adapts to non-linear patterns |
| [MEDIAN](/indicators/filters/median.md) | Median Filter | Non-linear filter that removes spikes and outliers while preserving edges |
| [NOTCH](/indicators/filters/notch.md) | Notch Filter | Removes specific frequency components while leaving others intact |
| [SGF](/indicators/filters/sgf.md) | Savitzky-Golay Filter | Polynomial regression-based filter that preserves higher moments |
| [SSF](/indicators/filters/ssf.md) | Ehlers Super Smooth Filter | Exceptional noise reduction with minimal lag using optimized pole placement |
| [USF](/indicators/filters/usf.md) | Ehlers Ultrasmooth Filter | Maximum noise suppression for major trend identification in volatile markets |
| [WIENER](/indicators/filters/wiener.md) | Wiener Filter | Optimizes signal-to-noise ratio based on statistical characteristics |
