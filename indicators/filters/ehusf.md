# Ultrasmooth Filter (USF)

The Ultrasmooth Filter implements an advanced smoothing algorithm that provides exceptional noise reduction with minimal lag. Based on John Ehlers' research, it uses optimized coefficients to achieve superior smoothing while maintaining signal fidelity.

## Mathematical Foundation

The filter is constructed using carefully chosen coefficients in a second-order structure:

USF = (1-c1)X + (2c1-c2)X₁ - (c1+c3)X₂ + c2×USF₁ + c3×USF₂

Where:

- a1 = exp(-1.414π/length)
- b1 = 2a1 × cos(1.414 × 180/length)
- c1 = (1 + c2 - c3)/4
- c2 = b1
- c3 = -a1²
- USF₁, USF₂ are the previous filter outputs
