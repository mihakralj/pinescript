# EOM: Ease of Movement

[Pine Script Implementation of EOM](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/volume/eom.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

The Ease of Movement (EOM) indicator, developed by Richard W. Arms Jr., is a volume-based oscillator designed to measure the "ease" with which price moves. It combines price changes and volume to assess the relationship between these two fundamental market elements. Unlike traditional volume indicators that focus solely on volume magnitude, EOM evaluates how efficiently price is moving relative to volume, providing insight into the force behind price trends.

EOM fluctuates above and below a zero line, with positive values indicating that prices are rising with relative ease (bullish) and negative values suggesting prices are falling with relative ease (bearish). The indicator is particularly valuable for identifying potential trend reversals, confirming existing trends, and measuring the strength behind price movements.

## Core Concepts

* **Volume-price efficiency:** Measures how much price movement occurs per unit of volume, indicating the "ease" of movement
* **Box ratio concept:** Uses a box ratio calculation to normalize volume relative to price range
* **Midpoint tracking:** Focuses on the movement of price midpoints rather than just closing prices
* **Zero-line significance:** Crossovers of the zero line signal potential changes in price direction

The core principle behind EOM is that in strong uptrends, prices should advance with relatively low volume (high ease), while in strong downtrends, prices should decline with relatively low volume. Conversely, when significant volume is required to move prices, it suggests increasing difficulty (or resistance) in the current direction, potentially signaling a weakening trend.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Length | 14 | Period for box ratio calculation | Shorter for more sensitivity, longer for smoother readings |
| Smoothing | 14 | Smoothing period for EOM | Increase to reduce noise, decrease for faster signals |
| High Source | High | Price data for range calculation | Rarely needs adjustment |
| Low Source | Low | Price data for range calculation | Rarely needs adjustment |
| Volume Source | Volume | Volume data for calculations | Consider adjusting when analyzing unusual volume characteristics |

**Pro Tip:** While the standard 14-period setting works well for daily charts, consider using shorter periods (7-10) for intraday analysis and longer periods (20-30) for weekly charts to maintain appropriate sensitivity across different timeframes.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
EOM tracks the change in the midpoint of the price range, divides this by a box ratio (volume normalized by the price range), and then averages these values over the specified period.

**Technical formula:**

1. Midpoint = (High + Low) / 2
2. Midpoint Change = Today's Midpoint - Yesterday's Midpoint
3. Box Ratio = Volume / (High - Low)
4. Raw EOM = Midpoint Change / Box Ratio
5. EOM = Average(Raw EOM, Length)

> üîç **Technical Note:** The implementation handles zero price range scenarios (High = Low) by returning NA for that bar, preventing division by zero errors. The smoothing process uses a simple moving average to reduce noise in the raw EOM values.

## Interpretation Details

The EOM indicator provides several analytical perspectives:

* **Zero line crossovers:** When EOM crosses above zero, it suggests prices are rising with relative ease (potential buy signal); crossing below zero suggests prices are falling with relative ease (potential sell signal)
* **Divergences:** When price makes a new high/low but EOM fails to confirm, it suggests the trend may be weakening (potential reversal signal)
* **Trend confirmation:** Strong EOM readings in the direction of the price trend help confirm the trend's strength
* **Volume efficiency:** EOM helps distinguish between price movements that are occurring efficiently (with low volume) versus those that require excessive volume
* **Congestion identification:** When EOM hovers near zero with minimal movement, it often indicates a period of price consolidation

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Volatility sensitivity:** Can be erratic during highly volatile periods, potentially generating false signals
* **Volume dependency:** Requires reliable volume data, making it less effective in markets with inconsistent volume reporting
* **Complementary tool:** Works best when used alongside price action analysis and other technical indicators
* **Range handling:** Becomes less reliable during extended sideways periods where both price range and volume may be subdued
* **Scaling issues:** Different securities may produce different typical EOM ranges, making direct comparisons challenging
* **Bar period dependency:** Calculations can vary significantly across different timeframes, requiring separate analysis for each
