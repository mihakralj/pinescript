| [ADL](/indicators/volume/adl.md) | Accumulation/Distribution Line | Relates price changes to volume to assess buying/selling pressure |
| [ADOSC](/indicators/volume/adosc.md) | Chaikin A/D Oscillator | Measures momentum of the Accumulation/Distribution Line |
| [AOBV](/indicators/volume/aobv.md) | Archer On-Balance Volume | Modified OBV incorporating intra-period price movement |
| [CMF](/indicators/volume/cmf.md) | Chaikin Money Flow | Measures money flow volume over a set period, typically 20 or 21 days |
| [EFI](/indicators/volume/efi.md) | Elder's Force Index | Combines price movement, direction, and volume to measure buying/selling power |
| [EOM](/indicators/volume/eom.md) | Ease of Movement | Relates price change to volume, highlighting periods of effortless price movement |
| [III](/indicators/volume/iii.md) | Intraday Intensity Index | Measures buying/selling pressure within the day's range using close position |
| [KVO](/indicators/volume/kvo.md) | Klinger Volume Oscillator | Compares short-term and long-term volume trends to identify potential reversals |
| [MFI](/indicators/volume/mfi.md) | Money Flow Index | Volume-weighted RSI, measures buying/selling pressure using price and volume |
| [NVI](/indicators/volume/nvi.md) | Negative Volume Index | Tracks price changes on days with lower volume, assuming smart money acts on quiet days |
| [OBV](/indicators/volume/obv.md) | On Balance Volume | Fundamental volume indicator using cumulative volume based on price direction |
| [PVD](/indicators/volume/pvd.md) | Price Volume Divergence | Systematic divergence detection between price and volume movements |
| [PVI](/indicators/volume/pvi.md) | Positive Volume Index | Tracks price changes on days with higher volume, assuming crowd behavior |
| [PVO](/indicators/volume/pvo.md) | Percentage Volume Oscillator | Compares short-term and long-term volume moving averages as percentages |
| [PVR](/indicators/volume/pvr.md) | Price Volume Rank | Ranks price performance relative to volume activity |
| [PVT](/indicators/volume/pvt.md) | Price Volume Trend | Cumulative volume adjusted by relative price changes, similar to OBV |
| [TWAP](/indicators/volume/twap.md) | Time Weighted Average Price | Average price weighted equally by time, used as execution benchmark |
| [TVI](/indicators/volume/tvi.md) | Trade Volume Index | Measures intra-day buying/selling pressure based on tick data |
| [VA](/indicators/volume/va.md) | Volume Accumulation | Cumulative volume adjusted by close position relative to range midpoint |
| [VF](/indicators/volume/vf.md) | Volume Force | Measures the force of volume behind price movements |
| [VO](/indicators/volume/vo.md) | Volume Oscillator | Difference between short and long volume moving averages showing volume momentum |
| [VROC](/indicators/volume/vroc.md) | Volume Rate of Change | Measures the speed at which volume is changing over time |
| [VWAP](/indicators/volume/vwap.md) | Volume Weighted Average Price | Average price weighted by volume, often used as a benchmark |
| AVWAP | Anchored VWAP | VWAP calculated from a specific anchor point (date/event) rather than session start |
| [VWAD](/indicators/volume/vwad.md) | Volume Weighted Accumulation/Distribution | Similar to ADL but weights accumulation/distribution by volume |
| [VWMA](/indicators/volume/vwma.md) | Volume Weighted MA | Moving average where each price point is weighted by its volume |
| [WAD](/indicators/volume/wad.md) | Williams Accumulation/Distribution | Measures cumulative buying/selling pressure by comparing closes to opens/highs/lows |
