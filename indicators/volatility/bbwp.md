# BBWP: Bollinger Band Width Percentile

[Pine Script Implementation of BBWP](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/volatility/bbwp.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) is an advanced volatility indicator that measures the current Bollinger Band Width relative to its historical range over a specified lookback period. Unlike the raw BBW indicator, BBWP provides a normalized perspective by expressing the current volatility level as a percentile ranking within its recent history, making it easier to identify extreme volatility conditions regardless of the absolute BBW values.

BBWP transforms the concept of volatility measurement from absolute values to relative rankings, allowing traders to quickly identify when current market volatility is unusually high or low compared to recent historical norms. This percentile-based approach makes BBWP particularly valuable for comparing volatility conditions across different time periods and market environments.

## Core Concepts

* **Percentile ranking:** BBWP expresses current BBW as a percentile (0-100%) within its historical range, providing immediate context for volatility levels
* **Historical context:** Compares current volatility against a user-defined lookback period, typically 252 bars (one trading year)
* **Extreme identification:** Values near 0% indicate extremely low volatility (potential squeeze conditions), while values near 100% indicate extremely high volatility
* **Market timing:** Helps identify optimal entry and exit points based on volatility cycles and mean reversion tendencies
* **Normalized comparison:** Enables consistent volatility analysis across different securities and timeframes

The core advantage of BBWP is its ability to provide immediate context for current volatility levels without requiring manual comparison to historical charts or complex calculations.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Period | 20 | Lookback period for Bollinger Band calculations | Decrease for faster volatility response, increase for smoother BBW readings |
| Source | Close | Price data used for calculation | Consider using HLC3 for more comprehensive price representation |
| StdDev Multiplier | 2.0 | Distance of bands from center line | Increase to capture wider price movements, decrease for tighter analysis |
| Lookback Period | 252 | Historical period for percentile calculation | Adjust based on timeframe: 252 for daily, 20-50 for shorter periods |

**Pro Tip:** Use BBWP readings below 20% to identify potential squeeze conditions and readings above 80% to identify periods of extreme volatility that may precede consolidation.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
BBWP first calculates the current Bollinger Band Width, then determines what percentile this value represents within a historical range of BBW values over the specified lookback period.

**Technical formula:**
1. Calculate BBW = 2 √ó (StdDev Multiplier √ó Standard Deviation of Source over Period)
2. Collect BBW values over the Lookback Period
3. Count how many historical BBW values are below the current BBW
4. BBWP = (Count of values below current BBW) / (Total historical values) √ó 100

**Detailed calculation steps:**
1. Compute current Bollinger Band Width using standard deviation method
2. Maintain a circular buffer of historical BBW values over the lookback period
3. For each new BBW value, count how many historical values are smaller
4. Express this count as a percentage of the total historical sample

> üîç **Technical Note:** The implementation uses dual circular buffers for optimal performance - one for calculating BBW and another for maintaining the historical BBW range. This approach ensures O(1) updates for new values while maintaining O(n) performance for percentile calculations where n is the lookback period.

## Interpretation Details

BBWP provides clear signals for volatility-based trading strategies:

* **Low BBWP Values (0-20%):**
  - Indicate current volatility is in the lowest 20% of recent history
  - Signal potential "squeeze" conditions with low market volatility
  - Often precede significant price breakouts or trend changes
  - Ideal conditions for volatility expansion strategies

* **Medium BBWP Values (20-80%):**
  - Represent normal volatility conditions within typical ranges
  - Suggest balanced market conditions without extreme volatility
  - May indicate continuation of existing trends
  - Less predictive for major volatility shifts

* **High BBWP Values (80-100%):**
  - Show current volatility is in the highest 20% of recent history
  - Indicate periods of extreme market volatility
  - Often coincide with significant news events or market stress
  - May signal potential volatility contraction ahead

* **BBWP Trends:**
  - Rising BBWP: Increasing volatility relative to history
  - Falling BBWP: Decreasing volatility relative to history
  - Stable BBWP: Consistent volatility environment

## Trading Applications

**Squeeze Identification:**
- BBWP below 20% for multiple periods indicates strong squeeze potential
- Combine with volume analysis to confirm low-volatility environments
- Prepare for breakout strategies when BBWP reaches extreme lows
- Use additional indicators to determine breakout direction

**Volatility Mean Reversion:**
- BBWP above 80% suggests potential volatility reduction ahead
- Consider reducing position sizes during extreme volatility periods
- Look for opportunities to fade extreme moves when volatility is historically high

**Market Timing:**
- Enter positions during low BBWP periods (anticipating volatility expansion)
- Scale out of positions during high BBWP periods (anticipating volatility contraction)
- Adjust stop-loss levels based on current volatility percentile

**Risk Management:**
- Use BBWP to adjust position sizing based on volatility environment
- Tighten risk management during high BBWP periods
- Increase position sizes cautiously during low BBWP squeeze conditions

## Signal Combinations

**Strong Squeeze Signals:**
- BBWP below 10% for 5+ consecutive periods
- Decreasing trading volume concurrent with low BBWP
- Price consolidation within narrow range during low BBWP

**Volatility Expansion Warnings:**
- BBWP rising rapidly from extreme lows
- Increasing volume during BBWP transition from low to medium ranges
- Price approaching key technical levels during low BBWP periods

**Overextension Signals:**
- BBWP above 90% for extended periods
- Divergence between price extremes and BBWP readings
- High BBWP coinciding with exhaustion patterns in price action

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Lookback dependency:** Results heavily influenced by the chosen historical period
* **Lag component:** Percentile calculations introduce some delay in extreme readings
* **Market regime changes:** Historical volatility patterns may not predict future behavior
* **False signals:** Not all low BBWP readings lead to significant volatility expansion
* **Parameter sensitivity:** Different lookback periods can produce significantly different readings
* **Extreme events:** Black swan events can distort percentile calculations for extended periods

## Comparison with Related Indicators

**BBWP vs. BBW:**
- BBWP: Normalized percentile ranking, easier to interpret across timeframes
- BBW: Absolute volatility measure, requires manual historical comparison

**BBWP vs. VIX (for equity markets):**
- BBWP: Historical volatility percentile, backward-looking
- VIX: Forward-looking implied volatility from options

**BBWP vs. Volatility Rank:**
- BBWP: Percentile-based ranking within historical range
- Vol Rank: Similar concept but may use different calculation methods

## Historical Context and Best Practices

BBWP is most effective when used as part of a comprehensive volatility analysis framework. The indicator works best in liquid markets with sufficient historical data and should be combined with other technical analysis tools for confirmation.

**Best Practices:**
- Use appropriate lookback periods for your trading timeframe
- Combine with volume analysis for confirmation
- Consider market regime and fundamental factors
- Backtest BBWP strategies before implementation
- Adjust thresholds based on market characteristics
