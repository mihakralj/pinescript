| [ACCBANDS](/indicators/channels/accbands.md) | Acceleration Bands | Bands plotted around a simple moving average, adjusting width based on volatility |
| [APCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/apchannel.md) | Andrews' Pitchfork | Trend channel tool using three points to project potential support/resistance levels |
| [ATRBANDS](/indicators/channels/atrbands.md) | ATR Bands | Bands plotted N times the Average True Range (ATR) above and below a moving average |
| [BBANDS](/indicators/channels/bbands.md) | Bollinger Bands | Bands plotted N standard deviations away from a simple moving average |
| [DCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/dchannel.md) | Donchian Channel | Plots highest high and lowest low over a period, identifying breakouts |
| [DECAYCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/decaychannel.md) | Decay Min-Max Channel | Adaptive channel that tracks extremes with exponential decay toward midpoint |
| [FCB](/indicators/channels/fcb.md) | Fractal Chaos Bands | Bands based on fractal geometry to capture market volatility and trends |
| [KCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/kchannel.md) | Keltner Channel | Volatility bands plotted above/below an EMA, using ATR to define width |
| [MAENV](/indicators/channels/maenv.md) | MA Envelope | Bands plotted a fixed percentage above and below a moving average |
| [JBANDS](/indicators/channels/jbands.md) | Jurik Volatility Bands | JMA-based volatility bands plotted above/below median price |
| [MMCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/mmchannel.md) | Min-Max Channel | Plots the highest high and lowest low over a specified lookback period (similar to Donchian) |
| [PCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/pchannel.md) | Price Channel | Similar to Donchian Channels, plots highest high and lowest low over a period |
| [REGCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/regchannel.md) | Regression Channels | Channel formed by parallel lines equidistant from a central linear regression line |

| [STBANDS](/indicators/channels/stbands.md) | Super Trend Bands | Bands derived from the SuperTrend indicator, acting as dynamic support/resistance |
| [UBANDS](/indicators/channels/ubands.md) | Ultimate Bands | Modified Bollinger Bands that use Ehlers' Ultrasmooth Filter to minimize lag |
| [UCHANNEL](/indicators/channels/uchannel.md) | Ultimate Channel | Modified Keltner Channel that uses Ehlers' Ultrasmooth Filter to reduce lag |
| [VWAPBANDS](/indicators/channels/vwapbands.md) | VWAP Bands | Bands plotted N standard deviations above and below the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) |
