# Price Channels and Bands

| Code | Name | Key Characteristics |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ACCBANDS](/indicators/channels/accbands.md) | Acceleration Bands | Bands plotted around a simple moving average, adjusting width based on volatility |
| [AP](/indicators/channels/ap.md) | Andrews' Pitchfork | Trend channel tool using three points to project potential support/resistance levels |
| [ATRBANDS](/indicators/channels/atrbands.md) | ATR Bands | Bands plotted N times the Average True Range (ATR) above and below a moving average |
| [BBANDS](/indicators/channels/bbands.md) | Bollinger Bands | Bands plotted N standard deviations away from a simple moving average |
| [DC](/indicators/channels/dc.md) | Donchian Channel | Plots highest high and lowest low over a period, identifying breakouts |
| FCB | Fractal Chaos Bands | Bands based on fractal geometry to capture market volatility and trends |
| [KC](/indicators/channels/kc.md) | Keltner Channel | Volatility bands plotted above/below an EMA, using ATR to define width |
| [MAENV](/indicators/channels/maenv.md) | MA Envelope | Bands plotted a fixed percentage above and below a moving average |
| [JBANDS](/indicators/channels/jbands.md) | Jurik Volatility Bands | JMA-based volatility bands plotted above/below median price |
| MASSI | Mass Index | Predicts trend reversals by analyzing the narrowing and widening of price ranges |
| MINMAX | Lowest and highest values | Plots the highest high and lowest low over a specified lookback period (similar to Donchian) |
| PCH | Price Channel | Similar to Donchian Channels, plots highest high and lowest low over a period |
| PPB | Pivot Points Bands | Bands created using calculated Pivot Point levels as potential support/resistance |
| REGC | Regression Channels | Channel formed by parallel lines equidistant from a central linear regression line |
| SDC | Standard Deviation Channel | Channel formed by plotting lines N standard deviations above and below a linear regression line |
| STARC | Stoller Average Range Channel | Bands plotted N times the Average True Range (ATR) above and below a simple moving average |
| STB | Super Trend Bands | Bands derived from the SuperTrend indicator, acting as dynamic support/resistance |
| VC | Volatility Cone | Visualizes expected future volatility range based on historical volatility term structure |
| VWAPB | VWAP Bands | Bands plotted N standard deviations above and below the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) |


| ABBER | Aberration | Measures deviation from a central moving average, often used with Bollinger Bands |
| BBW | Bollinger Band Width | Measures the difference between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands |
| BBWP | Bollinger Band Width Percentile | Measures the current Bollinger Band Width relative to its historical range |
