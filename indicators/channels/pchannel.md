# PCHANNEL: Price Channel

[Pine Script Implementation of PCHANNEL](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/channels/pchannel.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

The Price Channel is a simple volatility-based indicator that plots the highest high and the lowest low over a user-defined lookback period. It is very similar in concept and application to Donchian Channels. The channel visually represents the trading range of an asset over the specified period.

A middle line, typically the average of the upper and lower channel lines, can also be plotted to serve as a mean reference.

## Core Concepts

*   **Highest High:** The upper band represents the highest price reached during the lookback period.
*   **Lowest Low:** The lower band represents the lowest price reached during thelookback period.
*   **Trading Range:** The channel effectively shows the price extremes for the chosen period.
*   **Breakout Indication:** Prices moving above the upper channel or below the lower channel can signal potential breakouts and the start of new trends.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function                                                                 | When to Adjust                                                                                                                               |
| :-------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Length    | 20      | Lookback period for determining the highest high and lowest low.         | Shorter lengths make the channel more reactive to recent price action; longer lengths create a wider, smoother channel representing longer-term ranges. |

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
1.  For each bar, look back over the specified `Length`.
2.  Identify the absolute highest `high` price during that period. This forms the Upper Channel line.
3.  Identify the absolute lowest `low` price during that period. This forms the Lower Channel line.
4.  (Optional) The Middle Channel line is the average of the Upper and Lower Channel lines: `(Upper Channel + Lower Channel) / 2`.

**Technical formula:**
1.  **Upper Channel:**
    `UpperChannel = Highest(High, Length)`

2.  **Lower Channel:**
    `LowerChannel = Lowest(Low, Length)`

3.  **Middle Channel (optional):**
    `MiddleChannel = (UpperChannel + LowerChannel) / 2`

## Interpretation Details

*   **Support and Resistance:** The upper band can act as resistance, and the lower band as support.
*   **Breakouts:**
    *   A close above the Upper Channel suggests bullish strength and a potential upside breakout.
    *   A close below the Lower Channel suggests bearish pressure and a potential downside breakout.
*   **Trend Identification:**
    *   In an uptrend, prices may consistently touch or "ride" the Upper Channel.
    *   In a downtrend, prices may consistently touch or "ride" the Lower Channel.
*   **Volatility:** The width of the channel can give an indication of volatility. Wider channels suggest higher volatility over the lookback period.
*   **"Turtle Trading" Strategy:** Price Channels (like Donchian Channels) were famously used in the "Turtle Trading" system, where breakouts from the channel were used as entry signals.

## Limitations and Considerations

*   **Lag:** Like all indicators based on lookback periods, there's an inherent lag. The channel reflects past price action.
*   **Whipsaws:** In choppy, non-trending markets, breakouts can be false, leading to whipsaws.
*   **Parameter Choice:** The `Length` parameter is crucial. A length too short may generate many false signals, while one too long may miss timely entries.
*   **Not a Standalone System:** Best used in conjunction with other indicators (e.g., volume, trend indicators) or price action analysis for confirmation.
