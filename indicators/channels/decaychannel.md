# DECAYCHANNEL: Decay Min-Max Channel

[Pine Script Implementation of DECAYCHANNEL](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/channels/decaychannel.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

The Decay Min-Max Channel (DECAYCHANNEL) is an adaptive technical analysis tool that tracks the highest high and lowest low values over a specified period while implementing exponential decay toward their midpoint. Unlike traditional static channels that maintain fixed extreme values until new extremes occur, DECAYCHANNEL gradually reduces the distance between the upper and lower bounds over time, causing them to converge toward the channel's center. This decay mechanism creates a more responsive channel that adapts to changing market conditions by automatically reducing channel width when new extremes aren't established.

The implementation uses efficient circular buffer management and exponential decay mathematics to ensure optimal performance while providing traders with a dynamic view of support and resistance levels that naturally adjust to market momentum. By combining the reliability of extreme value tracking with the adaptability of decay functions, DECAYCHANNEL offers a unique perspective on market structure that balances historical significance with current market relevance.

## Core Concepts

* **Adaptive extreme tracking:** Maintains highest high and lowest low while gradually reducing their influence over time through exponential decay
* **Midpoint convergence:** Decay targets the mathematical center of the channel, creating natural compression during ranging markets
* **Period-based decay timing:** Decay rate automatically scales with the lookback period, ensuring consistent behavior across different timeframes
* **Dynamic support/resistance:** Provides evolving support and resistance levels that strengthen with fresh extremes and weaken over time
* **Market regime adaptation:** Channels naturally tighten during consolidation and expand during breakout movements

DECAYCHANNEL differs fundamentally from other channel indicators by acknowledging that historical extremes become less relevant over time. This approach creates channels that are more responsive to current market conditions while still respecting significant price levels, making it particularly effective for identifying when markets are transitioning between different phases.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Period | 100 | Lookback window for extreme value calculation and decay timing | Shorter (20-50) for more responsive channels; longer (200-500) for major structural levels |
| High Source | High | Data source for maximum value tracking | Rarely changed; could use close for different perspective |
| Low Source | Low | Data source for minimum value tracking | Rarely changed; could use close for different perspective |

**Pro Tip:** For swing trading, consider using period = 50 to capture intermediate-term extremes with moderate decay. For position trading, period = 200 provides more stable channels that reflect major market structure. The decay mechanism naturally creates tighter channels during consolidation and wider channels during trending moves, eliminating the need for manual parameter adjustments.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
DECAYCHANNEL tracks the highest high and lowest low over the specified period, then applies exponential decay to gradually move these values toward their midpoint. The decay rate uses true half-life mathematics, providing 50% convergence toward the center after the full period length, creating balanced channel compression that maintains visual clarity while adapting to market conditions.

**Technical formula:**

```
decayLambda = ln(2.0) / period
midpoint = (currentMax + currentMin) / 2
maxDecayRate = 1 - e^(-decayLambda √ó timeSinceNewMax)
minDecayRate = 1 - e^(-decayLambda √ó timeSinceNewMin)
currentMax = currentMax - maxDecayRate √ó (currentMax - midpoint)
currentMin = currentMin - minDecayRate √ó (currentMin - midpoint)
```

Where:
- ln(2.0) ‚âà 0.693 provides true half-life behavior with 50% convergence over the period
- timeSinceNewMax/Min tracks bars elapsed since each extreme was established
- Decay is applied independently to upper and lower bounds
- Values are constrained within period's actual highest high and lowest low

> üîç **Technical Note:** The implementation uses ln(2.0) to provide true half-life exponential decay behavior. This creates 50% convergence toward the midpoint over the period length, ensuring that channels maintain their analytical value while adapting to changing market conditions. After two periods, convergence reaches 75%, and after three periods, approximately 87.5%.

## Interpretation Details

DECAYCHANNEL provides sophisticated market insights through its adaptive behavior:

* **Fresh breakouts:** When price establishes new extremes, channels immediately expand and reset decay timing, highlighting significant market moves
* **Consolidation detection:** During ranging markets, channels gradually contract toward the midpoint, visually representing reduced volatility
* **Support/resistance evolution:** Channel boundaries strengthen when recently tested and weaken over time if not confirmed by new price action
* **Trend transition signals:** Channel compression often precedes significant directional moves, similar to volatility squeeze patterns
* **Multi-timeframe consistency:** Decay timing scales automatically with period length, maintaining consistent visual behavior across timeframes
* **Momentum indication:** Rapid channel expansion indicates strong momentum, while gradual compression suggests weakening directional bias
* **Entry timing:** Channel touches provide potential entry points, with effectiveness indicated by how recently the boundary was established

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Decay rate consistency:** The ln(2.0) half-life parameter provides standard exponential decay behavior across all markets and timeframes
* **Historical dependence:** Still relies on historical extremes, providing no predictive capability about future price movements
* **Complexity trade-off:** More sophisticated than simple min-max channels, requiring understanding of decay mechanics
* **Parameter selection:** Period length significantly affects both channel width and decay behavior
* **No directional bias:** Provides adaptive levels but no inherent indication of likely breakout direction
* **Initialization period:** Requires sufficient historical data to establish meaningful extreme values before decay becomes relevant
* **Market condition adaptation:** May generate different signal frequency in trending versus ranging markets
* **Confirmation requirement:** Most effective when combined with volume, momentum, or other technical confirmation
