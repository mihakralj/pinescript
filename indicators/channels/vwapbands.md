# VWAPBANDS: VWAP Bands

[Pine Script Implementation of VWAPBANDS](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/channels/vwapbands.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

VWAP Bands (VWAPBANDS) is a channel indicator that extends the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) concept by adding standard deviation bands above and below the central VWAP line. This indicator combines the volume-weighted fairness concept of VWAP with statistical volatility measurements, creating dynamic support and resistance levels that reflect both price-volume relationships and market volatility.

Unlike traditional moving average-based bands, VWAPBANDS uses volume-weighted variance calculations to determine band width, making the indicator particularly sensitive to volume-driven price movements. The bands automatically adjust to market conditions while maintaining their statistical significance, providing traders with reliable levels for identifying overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversal points.

## Core Concepts

* **Volume-weighted statistics:** Uses volume data to weight price observations, giving more importance to high-volume periods
* **Session-based calculation:** Resets calculations based on configurable time periods (daily, hourly, etc.)
* **Statistical significance:** Bands represent 1 and 2 standard deviations from the volume-weighted mean
* **Dynamic adaptation:** Band width adjusts automatically based on volume-weighted price variance
* **Multi-timeframe flexibility:** Supports various reset intervals from minutes to months
* **Institutional relevance:** Reflects the same VWAP calculations used by institutional traders

The key advantage of VWAPBANDS is its ability to combine the fairness concept of VWAP (where institutional orders are often benchmarked) with volatility-based support and resistance levels, making it particularly valuable for understanding institutional price levels and market structure.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Source | HLC3 | Price data used for VWAP calculation | Use Close for end-of-period analysis, HLC3 for comprehensive price representation |
| Session Reset | 1D | Time period for VWAP calculation reset | Match to trading strategy timeframe: intraday (1H, 4H), swing (1D), position (1W) |
| StdDev Multiplier | 1.0 | Distance of primary bands from VWAP in standard deviations | Increase for wider bands in volatile markets, decrease for tighter levels |
| Show 2nd Bands | True | Display secondary bands at 2x multiplier distance | Disable for cleaner charts, enable for additional confluence levels |

**Pro Tip:** Use daily reset for swing trading strategies, hourly reset for intraday scalping, and weekly reset for position trading to align the indicator with your trading timeframe.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
VWAPBANDS calculates the volume-weighted average price from the session start, then computes the volume-weighted variance of prices around this average. Standard deviation bands are plotted at 1x and 2x the multiplier distance from VWAP.

**Technical formula:**
1. VWAP = Œ£(Price √ó Volume) / Œ£(Volume)
2. Volume-Weighted Variance = Œ£(Price¬≤ √ó Volume) / Œ£(Volume) - VWAP¬≤
3. Standard Deviation = ‚àö(Volume-Weighted Variance)
4. Upper Band = VWAP + (Multiplier √ó Standard Deviation)
5. Lower Band = VWAP - (Multiplier √ó Standard Deviation)

**Detailed calculation steps:**
1. Initialize cumulative sums at session start (price√óvolume, volume, price¬≤√óvolume)
2. For each bar, add current values to cumulative sums if volume > 0
3. Calculate VWAP as ratio of cumulative price√óvolume to cumulative volume
4. Compute volume-weighted second moment and subtract VWAP squared for variance
5. Take square root of variance to get standard deviation
6. Plot bands at specified multiples of standard deviation from VWAP

> üîç **Technical Note:** The implementation uses session-based resets to ensure VWAP calculations align with market structure. Volume-weighted variance provides more accurate volatility measurement than simple price variance, as it reflects the actual trading intensity at different price levels.

## Interpretation Details

VWAPBANDS provides multiple layers of market analysis:

* **VWAP Line Analysis:**
  - Price above VWAP: Bullish bias, buyers in control above fair value
  - Price below VWAP: Bearish bias, sellers in control below fair value
  - Price oscillating around VWAP: Balanced market, fair value region

* **Band Interaction Signals:**
  - Price touching upper 1œÉ band: Potential resistance, consider profit-taking
  - Price touching lower 1œÉ band: Potential support, consider accumulation
  - Price beyond 2œÉ bands: Extreme conditions, potential mean reversion opportunity
  - Price consistently above/below bands: Strong trend continuation signal

* **Band Width Analysis:**
  - Expanding bands: Increasing volatility, larger price movements expected
  - Contracting bands: Decreasing volatility, potential breakout setup
  - Stable band width: Consistent volatility environment

* **Volume-Price Relationship:**
  - High volume near bands: Increased significance of support/resistance levels
  - Low volume near bands: Potential for false breakouts or weak reversals
  - Volume expansion with band breaks: Confirmation of directional moves

## Trading Applications

**Mean Reversion Strategy:**
- Buy when price touches or exceeds lower 1œÉ band with volume confirmation
- Sell when price reaches VWAP or upper bands
- Use 2œÉ bands for extreme mean reversion opportunities
- Set stops beyond 2œÉ levels to account for extended moves

**Trend Following Strategy:**
- Enter long positions when price breaks above upper bands with volume
- Enter short positions when price breaks below lower bands with volume
- Use VWAP as dynamic support/resistance in trending markets
- Trail stops using the opposite band or VWAP line

**Institutional Level Trading:**
- Monitor price action around VWAP for institutional interest
- Look for volume spikes when price approaches VWAP after extended moves
- Use VWAP as benchmark for order execution efficiency
- Identify accumulation/distribution phases based on VWAP interaction

**Breakout Strategy:**
- Monitor periods of contracting bands for potential breakouts
- Enter positions on volume-confirmed breaks beyond 1œÉ bands
- Target 2œÉ bands for profit-taking on breakout moves
- Use failed breakouts as contrarian signals

## Signal Combinations

**High-Probability Long Signals:**
- Price bounces off lower 1œÉ band with increasing volume
- Price reclaims VWAP after period below with strong volume
- Bullish divergence between price and volume at lower bands
- Multiple timeframe VWAP alignment supporting upward bias

**High-Probability Short Signals:**
- Price fails at upper 1œÉ band with declining volume
- Price breaks below VWAP after period above with strong volume
- Bearish divergence between price and volume at upper bands
- Multiple timeframe VWAP alignment supporting downward bias

**Consolidation Warnings:**
- Price oscillating between narrow bands around VWAP
- Decreasing volume with price approaching bands
- Multiple false breakouts beyond bands
- Band width contracting significantly

## Advanced Techniques

**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**
- Use higher timeframe VWAPBANDS for major support/resistance levels
- Combine daily VWAP with intraday bands for precision timing
- Look for confluence between different session VWAP levels
- Identify key levels where multiple timeframe VWAPs converge

**Volume Profile Integration:**
- Combine VWAPBANDS with volume profile for enhanced context
- Identify high-volume nodes near VWAP levels
- Use volume-at-price data to validate band significance
- Monitor institutional order flow around VWAP levels

**Session-Specific Analysis:**
- Analyze different session reset periods for various market conditions
- Use overnight VWAP for gap analysis and fair value assessment
- Apply weekly VWAP for longer-term institutional benchmarking
- Implement monthly VWAP for portfolio rebalancing levels

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Session dependency:** Reset timing significantly affects indicator behavior and relevance
* **Volume quality:** Requires accurate volume data; may be less reliable in low-volume periods
* **Lag component:** VWAP calculations create some lag, especially early in sessions
* **Market structure:** Most effective in liquid markets with consistent volume patterns
* **Gap handling:** Overnight gaps can affect VWAP relevance at session open
* **False signals:** Low-volume periods may produce unreliable band interactions

## Best Practices

**Parameter Optimization:**
