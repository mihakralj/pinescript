# DC: Donchian Channels

[Pine Script Implementation of DC](https://github.com/mihakralj/pinescript/blob/main/indicators/channels/dc.pine)

## Overview and Purpose

Donchian Channels are a versatile technical analysis tool developed by Richard Donchian in the mid-20th century. This indicator creates a price channel consisting of three lines: an upper band tracking the highest high over a specified period, a lower band tracking the lowest low, and a middle band representing the average of these extremes. Donchian Channels effectively visualize price volatility and potential support/resistance levels by highlighting the range within which prices have fluctuated over the lookback period.

## Core Concepts

* **Range identification:** Donchian Channels excel at defining dynamic support and resistance levels based on actual price extremes rather than statistical measures
* **Market application:** Particularly effective for breakout trading strategies, trend identification, and volatility assessment across various market conditions
* **Timeframe suitability:** **Multiple timeframes** work well, with shorter periods (10-20) for short-term trading signals and longer periods (20-55) for identifying significant support/resistance zones

Donchian Channels differ from other volatility-based channels (like Bollinger Bands) by using actual price extremes rather than statistical deviations, making them especially useful for trend-following strategies and breakout systems.

## Common Settings and Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Function | When to Adjust |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Period | 20 | Controls the lookback window for calculation | Decrease for more sensitivity to recent price action, increase for more stable channels |
| High Source | High | Data point used for upper band calculation | Change to different price data only for specific, specialized strategies |
| Low Source | Low | Data point used for lower band calculation | Change to different price data only for specific, specialized strategies |

**Pro Tip:** The "Donchian Channel Breakout" strategy, popularized by the Turtle Traders, traditionally uses a 20-day breakout for entry signals and a 10-day breakout in the opposite direction for exits. This asymmetric application often yields better results than using the same period for both.

## Calculation and Mathematical Foundation

**Simplified explanation:**
Donchian Channels track the highest high and lowest low over a specified period. For each bar, the indicator identifies the highest high and lowest low over the lookback period, then calculates a middle line as the average of these two extremes.

**Technical formula:**
Upper Band = Highest High of last n periods
Lower Band = Lowest Low of last n periods
Middle Band = (Upper Band + Lower Band) / 2

Where:
- n is the specified lookback period
- Highest High is the maximum high price observed during the period
- Lowest Low is the minimum low price observed during the period

> üîç **Technical Note:** The implementation uses monotonic deques with circular buffers for efficient calculation, maintaining O(1) time complexity for each new bar rather than repeatedly scanning the entire lookback period.

## Interpretation Details

Donchian Channels provide multiple trading signals and insights:

- **Breakout trading:** Price breaking above the upper band signals potential bullish momentum, while breaking below the lower band indicates potential bearish momentum
- **Range identification:** The width of the channel represents market volatility‚Äîwider channels indicate higher volatility
- **Trend strength:** In strong trends, price tends to "walk" along either the upper or lower band
- **Mean reversion:** The middle band often acts as a magnet for price, especially after extended moves to the outer bands

Traders may also use channel width (difference between upper and lower bands) as a standalone volatility measure to adjust position sizing or identify potential market regime changes.

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Market conditions:** Less effective during sideways, choppy markets where repeated false breakouts may occur
* **Lag factor:** By definition, the indicator is backward-looking and may not adapt quickly to sudden market changes
* **False signals:** Brief price spikes can trigger false breakout signals, especially with shorter lookback periods
* **Complementary tools:** Best combined with volume analysis, momentum indicators, or other confirmation tools to filter potential false signals
